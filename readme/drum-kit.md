#Hit the keys and rock on
creating a digital drum with JavaScript 

###Objective 
Build an app that transforms yourself into a (digital) drummer. Well, from a more technical point of view I simply want to ensure .wav files are played when a corresponding keyboard key is hit.

###Tasks
1. add an event listener for keydown
2. check if a corresponding audio file for event exists
    - YES: play sound 
    - NO: stop function 
3. animate the currently played key
4. set an transition end-event to remove the animation 

###Development

###Learnings
- end-event "transitionend"
- keyboard events and all the associated data 
- modularize functions
